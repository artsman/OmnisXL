BUILD NOTES
------------------------------------------

On Windows the ExcelFormat project must be built with different libxl libraries for Release and Debug.

Debug
-------
libxl-debug.lib -> points/links to -> libxl.dll

Release
-------
libxl.lib

The build systems are different because libxl.lib is a static library built with specific compiler 
options. (Multi-Threaded DLL /MD and No Debug).  While it may be possible to get a debug version that
is similar to the release version, it actually makes the Debug process easier since builds occur more 
quickly then they would with a Release version.  The LibXL-Headers/setup.h file contains the flags that
determine if LibXL will be linked statically(Release) or dynamically(Debug).

There are no special requirements for running Omnis Studio on Windows for the Release version; Just 
put the ExcelFormat.dll in the xcomp folder.  For the Debug version you must not only put the ExcelFormat.dll
in the xcomp folder(done for you by Visual Studio 2008 when OMNIS_XCOMP_PATH is setup), you must also place libxl.dll 
in the Omnis Studio folder next to the omnis.exe executable (This must be done manually).
